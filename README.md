# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using classification models.

Extended (for README intro / GitHub description)

This project implements Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains highly imbalanced transaction records, where fraudulent cases are rare compared to legitimate ones. The project focuses on:

📊 Data preprocessing & exploration: handling imbalance, feature scaling, PCA (if needed).

🤖 Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

⚖️ Imbalanced learning strategies: SMOTE, undersampling, oversampling, and class-weight tuning.

📈 Model evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC (emphasizing recall to reduce false negatives).

🔍 Goal: Build a robust fraud detection system that minimizes missed frauds while keeping false alarms manageable.

The repository includes reproducible code, experiments, and evaluation metrics to compare different approaches for tackling fraud detection in financial transactions.
